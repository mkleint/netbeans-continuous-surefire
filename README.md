netbeans-continuous-surefire
============================

experimental netbeans module for continuous execution of changed tests in maven projects

the idea is to keep a maven build around indefinitely and feed it tests to run on the given project 
based on what files are changed in the project


Please see https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=238543 for motivation
